        <h2>11:11 ᴘᴍ: ᴛʜᴇ ᴛɪᴍᴇ ᴏꜰ ʏᴏᴜʀ ᴍɪɴᴅ</h2>
        <p>
This time is important not because your wishes will come true, or the person you like will notice you, or your dreams will finally be achieved. It is important because your personality is shown at its greatest during this hour.
At 11:11 you will feel a surge of unexplainable emotions.This is the final hour of your day,which might have been good or bad so your mind will review it like you review your exam before turning it in, and then the mind will control your emotions accordingly.
So if you had a bad day, a new hope will be created for the day that follows so that you can move on and look forward.
Whereas if it was a good day you will look more towards your future and wish for something greater.
In either cases your mind is creating hope and drawing new futures for you so that you don't give up.
Your mind does that becuase humans are greedy by nature, always wanting more and if we stop having hope we die.
Hence Your soul,body and mind are all working together so you can have a fresh start.
So when a thought occurs to you during this time don't consider it as a wish,
See it as a plan, a future, a project that you must work on and achieve, not just pray and leave it in the hands of destiny.
Your wish is your destiny and your dreams are your future as long as you work on them.
Hope is what keeps us living but if you leave hope as just a wish with each 11:11 you will lose it and your own hope will kill you and leave you given up,tired and broken.
So whatever the thought that occurs to you during this time .Just Do It!
You miss someone?Talk to them.
Like someone? Say it.
Want to achieve something?Plan and work on it
Don't like your life? Change it.
You can fight your way back into the light you dream of and can make the stars that you wish upon be your only limit.
"The kingdom of god is in man, not in one man nor a group of men,but in all of YOU.
YOU the people.
YOU have the power to create your happiness, to make your life free and beautiful, to make it a wonderful adventure."
So next time you see 11:11, think carefully,draw your plan and go and get it before its too late, because there may not be another 11:11 for you to wish upon!
